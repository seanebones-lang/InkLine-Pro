# Proprietary Rights and Enforcement Notice for NextEleven LLC Repositories

**Effective Date: January 7, 2026**

**Issued by: NextEleven LLC, Frisco, Texas, USA*

**As Corporate Attorney for NextEleven LLC:** This document serves as the binding legal framework governing all intellectual property contained within any GitHub repositories owned, maintained, or controlled by NextEleven LLC (hereinafter "the Company"). This is not an open-source license. This is a zero-tolerance, all-encompassing proprietary protection declaration designed to annihilate any unauthorized interaction with our creations. Every line of code, every file, every commit, every idea, design, algorithm, architecture, documentation, graphic, script, configuration, data structure, user interface element, or any other tangible or intangible element (collectively, "the Works") is the exclusive property of NextEleven LLC. We will hunt down violators with unrelenting fury, leveraging every legal avenue available under United States federal law, Texas state law, international treaties, and the laws of any jurisdiction where infringement occurs. There are no loopholes. There is no mercy. Violation means war.

## 1. Absolute Ownership and Copyright Assertion
All Works in these repositories are protected by copyright under the United States Copyright Act of 1976 (as amended, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 and subsequent updates through December 2025), the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty, and equivalent laws in every country worldwide. Copyright © 2026 NextEleven LLC. All rights reserved worldwide.

- **No Implied Rights:** Nothing in these repositories grants any license, sublicense, permission, or right—express, implied, statutory, or otherwise—to view, access, download, copy, modify, distribute, perform, display, transmit, or otherwise use the Works in any manner whatsoever without prior written authorization from an executive officer of NextEleven LLC.
- **Automatic Protection:** Protection attaches immediately upon creation, without need for registration (though we reserve the right to register copyrights formally for enhanced enforcement). As of December 2025, U.S. copyright law provides for statutory damages up to $150,000 per willful infringement, and we will seek the maximum in every case.
- **Trade Secrets and Confidential Information:** Any non-public elements, including but not limited to source code, proprietary algorithms, business logic, or internal documentation, are trade secrets under the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 (18 U.S.C. § 1839) and Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 134A). Misappropriation will trigger civil and criminal penalties, including treble damages and attorneys' fees.

## 2. Prohibited Activities: A Comprehensive Blacklist
You are expressly forbidden from engaging in any of the following, directly or indirectly, anywhere in the world:

- **Copying or Reproduction:** Duplicating any part of the Works, in whole or in part, including but not limited to cloning repositories via Git, forking, mirroring, scraping, screenshotting, photographing, or any other form of replication.
- **Stealing or Misappropriation:** Accessing, downloading, or extracting the Works without permission, including through automated tools, bots, APIs, or manual means. This includes "inspiration" that results in substantially similar creations—we will pursue derivative works as infringements under 17 U.S.C. § 106.
- **Cloning or Forking:** Creating any derivative, modified, or adapted version of the Works, whether for personal, commercial, educational, or any other use. Reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, or attempting to derive source code is a direct violation under the DMCA's anti-circumvention provisions (17 U.S.C. § 1201), punishable by up to $500,000 in fines and 5 years imprisonment for first offenses.
- **Distribution or Sharing:** Uploading, posting, emailing, linking, or otherwise disseminating the Works or any portion thereof on any platform, including but not limited to other GitHub repos, GitLab, Bitbucket, SourceForge, personal websites, social media, forums, cloud storage, or physical media.
- **Public Performance or Display:** Demonstrating, showcasing, or integrating the Works into any product, service, presentation, or public medium without explicit license.
- **Commercial Exploitation:** Using the Works in any business, startup, app, software, hardware, AI model training, or revenue-generating activity. This includes indirect uses like benchmarking or competitive analysis.
- **Educational or Non-Profit Use:** No exemptions for "fair use" claims—we will contest and litigate any asserted fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107, demanding proof of transformative nature, minimal portion used, and no market harm (which we assert is always present).
- **AI and Machine Learning:** Feeding any Works into AI systems for training, generation, or analysis constitutes theft and will be pursued as copyright infringement, consistent with emerging case law as of December 2025 (e.g., extensions of Getty Images v. Stability AI precedents).
- **International Violations:** If you are outside the U.S., we invoke the Universal Copyright Convention, TRIPS Agreement (under WTO), and bilateral treaties to enforce in your jurisdiction. We will use long-arm statutes (e.g., Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code § 17.042) to haul you into Texas courts.

Any attempt to circumvent these prohibitions, including through VPNs, proxies, anonymous accounts, or offshore entities, will be treated as willful infringement, escalating damages.

## 3. Enforcement: Ruthless Pursuit and Maximum Damages
We do not negotiate. We do not settle lightly. Violation triggers immediate and aggressive action:

- **Cease and Desist:** You will receive a demand to immediately cease all infringing activities, delete all copies, and provide a sworn affidavit of compliance.
- **Litigation:** We will file suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Frisco jurisdiction) or any appropriate international court. We seek:
  - **Injunctive Relief:** Permanent injunctions to stop your activities, under 17 U.S.C. § 502.
  - **Damages:** Actual damages, profits from infringement, statutory damages (up to $150,000 per work), treble damages for trade secret misappropriation, and punitive damages where available (e.g., under Texas law for willful conduct).
  - **Attorneys' Fees and Costs:** Full recovery under 17 U.S.C. § 505 and equivalent laws.
  - **Criminal Prosecution:** Referral to the FBI, DOJ, or international authorities for criminal copyright infringement (17 U.S.C. § 506, up to 10 years imprisonment for repeat offenders) or trade secret theft (18 U.S.C. § 1832).
- **Global Reach:** Through mutual legal assistance treaties (MLATs) and partnerships with firms in Europe (GDPR-aligned enforcement), Asia (e.g., China's Anti-Unfair Competition Law), and beyond, we will enforce judgments worldwide. Assets will be seized, domains frozen, and reputations destroyed.
- **Monitoring and Detection:** We employ automated tools, watermarking, digital fingerprints, and third-party services to detect infringements. GitHub's DMCA takedown process will be invoked instantly (under 17 U.S.C. § 512), but we go further—suing platforms for contributory infringement if they fail to act.
- **No Statute of Limitations Escape:** We will pursue claims within the three-year U.S. copyright statute (17 U.S.C. § 507), but tolling applies for concealed infringements. International claims follow local limits, extended by discovery rules.

## 4. Indemnification and Liability
By accessing these repositories, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless NextEleven LLC, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims arising from your violations. You are liable for all consequential, incidental, and exemplary damages. No limitations of liability apply— we disclaim all warranties, and you assume all risks.

## 5. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
This notice is governed by the laws of the State of Texas and the United States, without regard to conflict of laws. Exclusive venue: State or federal courts in Collin County, Texas. You consent to personal jurisdiction and waive any objections.

## 6. Severability and No Waiver
If any provision is held invalid, the remainder remains in full force. Failure to enforce any right does not constitute waiver—we reserve all rights to act at any time.

## 7. Amendments
We may amend this notice unilaterally by updating the repository. Continued access constitutes acceptance.

**Warning:** Ignore this at your peril. NextEleven LLC is backed by top-tier legal counsel ready to deploy. Your IP address, access logs, and metadata are monitored. Proceed only if authorized.
